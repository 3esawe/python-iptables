[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ldx/python-iptables.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ldx/python-iptables)

Python-iptables is a pythonesque wrapper around the Linux iptables/ip6tables facility. It is meant primarily for dynamic and/or complex firewalls, where rules are often updated or changed. Python-iptables makes it possible to use Python to parse or change rules without the need to spawn processes to execute an iptables command.

See [http://ldx.github.com/python-iptables/](http://ldx.github.com/python-iptables/) for documentation.
